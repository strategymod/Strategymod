# StrategyMod Private Server Documentation & Research Hub

[StrategyMod](https://strategymod.com/) is a documentation-focused hub dedicated to the **study, explanation, and structured presentation of private server environments** for popular strategy-based mobile games such as **Clash of Clans** and **Clash Royale**. This repository serves as a **central reference point** for technical concepts, architectural models, configuration examples, and public documentation related to StrategyMod projects.

The primary goal of StrategyMod is **education, transparency, and documentation**. All content published here is designed to help readers understand how private server ecosystems work from a conceptual and technical perspective—without interacting with or modifying official production servers.

## About StrategyMod

StrategyMod operates as an **independent documentation and research initiative**. It is not a game publisher, not an official game server provider, and not affiliated with Supercell or any other game development company.

This GitHub organization exists to:

* Document private server concepts in a structured manner
* Publish configuration samples and architectural references
* Maintain public notices, disclaimers, and change logs
* Provide transparency through open documentation

---

## What Is a Private Server?

A private server is a **non-official, isolated server environment** that emulates certain aspects of a game for testing, experimentation, or educational analysis. Unlike official servers, private servers:

* Operate in sandboxed or non-production environments
* Do not connect to official publisher infrastructure
* Use test data and virtual configurations
* Are commonly used for learning, balancing experiments, and feature simulations

This repository discusses private servers **only at a conceptual and documentation level**.

---

## Project Scope

StrategyMod repositories focus on:

* High-level architecture explanations
* Conceptual feature descriptions
* Sample configuration formats
* Resource modeling (non-production)
* Security and isolation best practices
* Public documentation and legal notices

The scope explicitly **excludes**:

* Official game assets
* Proprietary source code
* Methods to bypass protections
* Instructions to access official servers

---

## Repository Structure

Typical repositories under StrategyMod may include:

* `private-server-basics`
* `clash-royale-private-server-docs`
* `coc-private-server-structure`
* `private-server-security-notes`
* `strategymod-public-notices`

Each repository is maintained with clear documentation and version tracking.

---

## Common Private Server Features (Conceptual)

Private server environments often demonstrate features such as:

* Sandbox-based gameplay logic
* Test resources for experimentation
* Custom configuration layers
* Debug and logging modes
* Non-commercial testing features

These features are described strictly for **informational purposes**.

---

## Configuration & Architecture Overview

StrategyMod documentation may include:

* Example configuration files (YAML / JSON)
* High-level server flow diagrams
* Data model representations
* Feature toggles and environment flags

All examples are **generic, simulated, and non-production**.

---

## Security & Isolation Principles

Security is a core documentation focus. Best practices discussed include:

* Complete isolation from official servers
* No collection of personal user data
* Transparent logging mechanisms
* Sandboxed environments for testing
* Clear separation between test and live systems

---
